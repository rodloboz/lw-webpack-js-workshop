## 1 - Animate text with `typed.js`

The landing page, which is rendered by `home#pages`, has a banner with a main heading, a subheading and a search input.

![landing banner](https://github.com/rodloboz/workshops/blob/master/images/01-devhire/Screen%20Shot%202018-11-02%20at%2009.53.35.png?raw=true)

Let's animate the subheading with `typed.js` so that instead of a static sentence, the user will see animated programming language names (`ruby`, `react`, `elixir`, `python`, `swift`) behind the **_devs in the world_**.

**Remember** that no javascript should go in the asset pipeline. We will be coding all javascript in `app/javascript/` and `app/javascript/packs/application.js` is webpack's entry point as required in the `application.html.erb` layout file:

```html
<%= javascript_pack_tag 'application' %>
```

First create a `components` folder inside `app/javascript/`. This is where we will code all of our javascript features.

Create a file `banner.js` inside components. We'll implement the dynamic banner text here. Add `typed.js` to your project using the `yarn` package manager:

```shell
yarn add typed.js
````
Create a function `loadDynamicBannerText` in banner.js.

We have prepared the markup with an element **#js-typed-text** to act as the target for the `Typed` function.

Once you've implemented the feature don't forget to **export** it and then **import** it in `application.js`.

Done? Good! Time to `commit` and `push`.

## 2 - Animate navbar on scroll!

Still on the landing page, our transparent sticky navbar looks strange once you scroll past the banner. Let's update it on scroll!

Create a `navbar.js` in the components folder to implement features related to the navbar.

On the landing page, the navbar starts with the class **`navbar-wagon-transparent`**, which has the properties to make it transparent, and the class **`navbar-wagon-filled`** styles a white navbar.

You can add an __event listener__ to `window` to listen to the `scroll` event. When the window scrolls past halfway of the banner you should __remove__ the `navbar-wagon-transparent` class and __add__ the `navbar-wagon-filled` class. When you scroll back up, you need to implement the reverse behaviour.

__Hint:__ The window object has a `scrollY` which gives you its y-axis or vertical position and an `innerHeight` that measures how tall the window is.

Don't forget to **export** and **import** your function. Test it and once it's working it's a good time to `commit` and `push`.

## 3 - Autocomplete suggestions with `js-autocomplete`

For the remaining feature of the landing page, we want to have the search input display **suggestions** as the user enters search terms.

A popular implementation of this featue is with Twitter's robust `typeahead.js` and `bloodhound`, but the same effect can be achieved with the simpler `js-autocomplete`.

This library allows  _asyncronous_ requests to fetch data from a remote backend, but when the amount of data is not significant (as in this case), it is better to send all the data to the frontend so that we don't have to send http requests as the user types.

The **id** `#search-data` has been added to the search input element, which receives a stringified json with all the programming languages in the database. Use this selector to read and parse the `dataset-skills`.

You can create the `autocomplete.js` file inside your components folder. To require the library run from the terminal:

```shell
yarn add js-autocomplete
```

You can find this npm package's documentation :point_right: [here](https://goodies.pixabay.com/javascript/auto-complete/demo.html).

Don't forget that this package is shipped with its own **css styles**, so you'll need to import them. You can do this by uncomenting `<%= stylesheet_pack_tag 'application', media: 'all' %>` in `application.html`. Then create a `application.css` file in `app/javascript/packs` and add the following:

```javascript
// app/javascript/packs/application.js
import './application.css';
```

```scss
// app/javascript/packs/application.css
@import 'js-autocomplete/auto-complete.css';
```

When you're done, `commit` and `push`.

## 4 - Bookmarking developers

When users are logged in, they can **bookmark** their favorite developers for future reference. There is a _bookmark icon_ on the top-right corner to each developer card.

![developer card](https://github.com/rodloboz/workshops/blob/master/images/01-devhire/Screen%20Shot%202018-11-05%20at%2014.21.54.png?raw=true)

Right now nothing happens when the user clicks on the icon. Let's change that.

Start by creating a `bookmarking.js` component file. The idea is to add a `click` event listener to each icon which will submit a `post` request to `/bookmarked_developers` to create with the `developer_id` in the body to _create_ a new bookmark **OR** a `delete` request to `/bookmarked_developers/:id` with the `developer_id` in the body to _destroy_ an existing bookmark.

After the server responds, you should **toggle** the respective icon. You can select all icons using the selector `.dev-bookmark i`. Each icon is a _fontawesome_ icon that is **full** (or bookmarked) when it has the class `fas` and is **empty** (or not bookmarked) when it has the class `far`. You should toggle between these two classes.

To communicate with the rails backend, use the `fetch` API. Fetch works with `promisses`, so you can wait for the backend to respond before **toggling** an icon. Here's an example of a fetch request with a promisse:

```javascript
fetch('/posts', {
    method: 'post',
    body: JSON.stringify({content: 'Hello world!'}),
    headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
})
    .then(() => console.log('You have just created a post!'))
    .catch(error => console.log('Something went wrong...', error));
```

**Hint**: You can get the `developer_id` from the parent developer card of the icon - they have *ids* in the following format: `id="dev-4"`.

Test the app in the browser and use the rails console `rails c` to confirm if the bookmarks are being sucessfully created and deleted.

## 5 - Adding a Datepicker (`flatpickr`)

Let's move to the developer's individual page: `show#developers`. There's a lot of things missing here, but we'll start with the **booking widget**.

Users should be able to book a developer by picking a _start date_ and an _end date_ date. The backend already has the validation to only accept a booking if **both** dates are present.

Developers have _no unavailable dates_ (they are **always** available). The only **restrictions** are that a user cannot book dates in the past and the _end date_ must be greater than the _start date_.

We'll use `flatpickr` for the calendar picker.

Read the documentation and have a look at the examples here :point_right: https://flatpickr.js.org/

`yarn add flatpickr` to install the npm package and then create a `booking.js` component file and `import flatpickr from 'flatpickr'`.

**Note:** `flatpickr` comes with it's own css styling, so we'll need to load it in `app/javascript/packs/application.css`:

```scss
@import 'flatpickr/dist/flatpickr.css';
```

You will need to create two instances of flatpickr: one for the **start date** and another for the **end date**. The selectors you want to target for each of these are the classes `booking_start_date` and `booking_end_date`.

To create an instance of `flatpickr`, pass the input element via a **selector** and an object `{}` of **options** to `flatpickr`. There are several options available, from specifying the `minDate` and `dateFormat` to providing _callback_ functions on specific **events** like in the example below:

```javascript
flatpickr(inputSelector, {
    minDate: 'today',
    dateFormat: 'd-m-Y',
    onChange: function(selectedDates, selectedDate) {
      // DO SOMETHING
    }
  })
```

**Note:** The _end date input_ should be **disabled** if the _start date input_ is blank.

## 6 - Calculating booking total!

Once the user picks the _start date_ and the _end date_, we should **update** and **display** the total price calculation.

For simplicity, we'll assume that the developer will work **6 hours** on each day they are booked. There is also a **15% service charge** which should be applied to the **subtotal** in order to calculate the **total price**.

Here's what we're going for:

![developer card](https://github.com/rodloboz/workshops/blob/master/images/01-devhire/Screen%20Shot%202018-11-07%20at%2013.40.19.png?raw=true)

On the inital page load, the costs element (`.costs`) is not visible. After the user has picked the _end date_ you should **calculate** and **update** the costs and make this element visible by adding the class `is-visible`.

**Hint:** You might want to use the flatpickr event `onChange`.

Define a function `updateCosts` which received the number of `hours` booked, which is difference in days between the `endDate` and the `startDate` times *6*.

```javascript
let hours = Math.ceil((endDate - startDate) / (1000 * 3600 * 24)) * 6;
```

You can use the following helper function to parse dates from the input fields:

```javascript
const parseDate = (string) => {
  const pattern = /(\d{2})-(\d{2})-(\d{4})/;
  return new Date(string.replace(pattern,'$3-$2-$1'));
}
```

And another helper function to display the price values with commas:

```javascript
const numberWithCommas = (number) => {
  return number.toString().replace(/\B(?=(\d{3})+(?!\d))/g, ",");
}
```

Remember that if the user _clears_ any of the date inputs, you should **hide** the costs section by removing the class `is-visible`.

Play with the [demo](https://devhire-demo.herokuapp.com/) until you get the same behaviour.

Once you're done, `commit` and `push`.

## 7 - Adding a carousel slider (`tiny-slider`)

One last thing to do in the developers page.

At the end of the developers page, there is a portfolio section showcasing the work of each developer. Right now it doesn't look very nice - it's just one long column. Let's turn this section into a carousel **slider**!

![portfolio slider](https://github.com/rodloboz/workshops/blob/master/images/01-devhire/Screen%20Shot%202018-11-07%20at%2016.28.42.png?raw=true)

We'll be using `tiny-slider`, which is a vanilla javascript package, to implement the carousel slider.

Documentation here :point-right: https://github.com/ganlanyuan/tiny-slider

Start by installing the `tiny-slider` with `yarn`. Create `portfolio.js` inside the javascript components file and import:

```javascript
import { tns } from 'tiny-slider/src/tiny-slider';
```

Don't forget to also import the css in the appropriate css file:

```scss
@import 'tiny-slider/dist/tiny-slider.css';
```

To target the container of the project cards use the selector `#js-projects`. This is the container element for tiny slider. We will also be using custom navigation elements, so we want to disable tiny slider's default `nav` and `controls` elements. You should also specity the `gutter` size and the number of `items` you want to display on each `page` (it accepts floating point numbers).

The custom navigation controls are styled with the classes `chevron-left` to go back (_previous_) and `chevron-right` to go forward (_next_). You will need to add a `click` event to each of these controls and call the function `goTo` on the slider instance in order to go back (`'prev'`) or forward (`'next'`).

Test in the browser that the carousel slider behaves as expected and `commit` and `push`.

## 8 - Using a jQuery plugin (`select2`)

So far we've been using vanilla javascript and packages. Let's use a jQuery plugin.

If a user is logged in, they can create their own _developer profile_ by clicking on **Become a developer** link on the navbar. Here, among other things, they will be able to select their current skills. Right now, the **multiple select input** is looking rather boring. Let's __selectize__ it!

Here's what we're going for:
![portfolio slider](https://github.com/rodloboz/workshops/blob/master/images/01-devhire/Screen%20Shot%202018-11-07%20at%2019.22.41.png?raw=true)

Because we're using `bootstrap`, we've already configured `webpack` to use `jQuery` as a plugin in `environment.js`:

```javascript
// Bootstrap 3 has a dependency over jQuery:
const webpack = require('webpack')
environment.plugins.prepend('Provide',
  new webpack.ProvidePlugin({
    $: 'jquery',
    jQuery: 'jquery'
  })
)
```

Install the package `select2` with `yarn`, create a `select.js` component. Import both `jQuery` and the `select2` plugin and its **css stylesheet** located in `select2/dist/css/select2.css`:

```javascript
import $ from 'jquery';
import 'select2';
```

The selector for the skills input is `#developer_skill_ids`. You can target this selector with `$` and call `select2()` on it. That's it! Our multiple select input has been greatly improved.

## 9 - Adding behaviour to the search subnavbar

Let's add some behaviour to the _search subnavbar_ on `index#developers`.

When the user clicks on the search icon, the _input_ should become visible with a blue bottom border. At the same time, the icon should become hidden.

This can be achieved by removing class `is-visible` from the search icon (`.search-icon`) and adding the class `is-visible` to the search input (`.search-input`).

Create a `subnav.js` file and implement the behaviour in a function `animateSubnavInput`.

**Hint:** Use the `focus` and `focusout` events.

## 10 - Filtering results with a range slider (`nouislider`)

Finally, we want to add the possibility to filter our search results in `index#developers` by providing a price/hourly rate range using a **range slider** in the UI.

There are many range sliders libraries, namely as jQuery plugins, but some require setting up jQuery UI in webpack which can be a bit cumbersome.

We're going to use a vanilla javascript library called `nouislider` :point_right: https://refreshless.com/nouislider/

You can use the same `subnav.js` component file to implement a new function `initRangeSlider`. Add `nouislider` to the project with `yarn` and import the respective css:

```scss
@import 'nouislider/distribute/nouislider.css';
```

Some of the `nouislider` styling has been overriden with custom styling. You can have a look at the classes that have been restyled in the asset pipiline: `app/assets/stylesheets/components/_range.scss`. In order to achieve this, the order of the _stylesheet import tags_ had to be reversed in `application.html` layout file: first, the webpack stylesheets and then the asset pipeline stylesheets.

```html
<%= stylesheet_pack_tag 'application', media: 'all' %>
<%= stylesheet_link_tag 'application', media: 'all' %>
```

The target for the slider is the element with id `slider-range`. Our app is also passing to the frontend the **minimum** and **maximum** selected values via the _dataset_ properties `min` and `max`. You will need to parse this information from the elements with the selectors `#min-price input` and `#max-price input`.

Here's the configuration being used on the demo, where `min` and `max` stand for the said parsed values.

```javascript
noUiSlider.create(slider, {
    start: [min, max],
    connect: true,
    step: 10,
    range: {
        'min': 0,
        'max': 600
    }
});
```

`Export` and `import` this new function and test it in the browser.

If everything is working as excepted, you will notice that the values on the search subnavbar are not updating. Make use of the `nouislider` event `update` to update the minimum and maximum input values.

Also, you've probably noticed that the range dropdown closes as soon as the user clicks on it or releases the range _handles_. Let's fixe that!

Target the slider container (`#slider-container`) with a `click` event and stop the default event behaviour with `stopPropagation`.

Finally, have the form submit when the _Apply_ button is clicked. You can add the a `click` event to `.submit_link` and submit the form by targeting the hidden submit button `#subnav-form__submit`.
